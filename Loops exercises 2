i = 1
bai2 = str(i)
print(bai2)
# i += 1
# while 1 < i <= 5:
#     bai2 += " " + str(i)
#     print(bai2)
#     i += 1
# 1
# 1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5

bai2 = ""
for i in range(1, 6):
    bai2 += str(i) + " "
    print(bai2)

Explanation: this give string type to variable bai2, then it loops the action in the range 1 to 6

Give solution is below. It's more like a software. From now on I will think about making a software.

print("Number Pattern ")

# Decide the row count. (above pattern contains 5 rows)
row = 5
start: 1
stop: row+1 (range never include stop number in result)
step: 1
# run loop 5 times
for i in range(1, row + 1, 1):
    # Run inner loop i+1 times
    for j in range(1, i + 1):
        print(j, end=' ')
    # empty line after each row
    print(""

Write a program to accept a number from a user and calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given number
n = 19
# include what numbers?
numbers = list(range(1, n+1, 1))
total_sum = 0
# what is the total?
for num in numbers:
    total_sum += num
# print result
print("Sum is:", total_sum)
