#Quiz: Tag Counter
#Write a for loop that iterates over a list of strings, tokens, and counts how many of them are XML tags. XML is a data language similar to HTML. You can tell if a string is an XML tag if it begins with a left angle bracket "<" and ends with a right angle bracket ">". Keep track of the number of tags using the variable count.

#You can assume that the list of strings will not contain empty strings.

tokens = ['<greeting>', 'Hello World!', '</greeting>']
count = 0

# write your for loop here
for token in tokens:
    if token.startswith('<') and token.endswith('>'):
        count += 1

print(count)

# TIL starswtih() endswith()

#Need to learn more about loops

#Exercises for loops:

#1. Print First 10 natural numbers using while loop

#i = 1
#while i <= 10:
    #print(i)
    #i += 1

#2. Print the following pattern

i1 = 1
string = str(i1)
print(string, '\n')

i2 = 2
string2 = string + " " + str(i2)
print(string2, '\n')

i3 = 3
string3 = string2 + " " + str(i3)
print(string3, '\n')

#Print:
1 
1 2 
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5

i = 1
bai2 = str(i)
print(bai2)
i += 1
while 1 < i <= 5:
    bai2 += " " + str(i)
    print(bai2)
    i += 1
# The suggested solution is different because I was not familiar with methods. Still worked. Woooo!!!
