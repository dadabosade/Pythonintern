#Quiz: Tag Counter
#Write a for loop that iterates over a list of strings, tokens, and counts how many of them are XML tags. XML is a data language similar to HTML. You can tell if a string is an XML tag if it begins with a left angle bracket "<" and ends with a right angle bracket ">". Keep track of the number of tags using the variable count.

#You can assume that the list of strings will not contain empty strings.

tokens = ['<greeting>', 'Hello World!', '</greeting>']
count = 0

# write your for loop here
for token in tokens:
    if token.startswith('<') and token.endswith('>'):
        count += 1

print(count)

# TIL starswtih() endswith()

#Need to learn more about loops

#Exercises for loops:

#1. Print First 10 natural numbers using while loop

#i = 1
#while i <= 10:
    #print(i)
    #i += 1

#2. Print the following pattern

i1 = 1
string = str(i1)
print(string, '\n')

i2 = 2
string2 = string + " " + str(i2)
print(string2, '\n')

i3 = 3
string3 = string2 + " " + str(i3)
print(string3, '\n')

#Print:
1 
1 2 
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5

i = 1
bai2 = str(i)
print(bai2)
i += 1
while 1 < i <= 5:
    bai2 += " " + str(i)
    print(bai2)
    i += 1
# The suggested solution is different because I was not familiar with methods. Still worked. Woooo!!!

bai2 = ""
for i in range(1, 6):
    bai2 += str(i) + " "
    print(bai2)

Explanation: this give string type to variable bai2, then it loops the action in the range 1 to 6

Give solution is below. It's more like a software. From now on I will think about making a software.

print("Number Pattern ")

# Decide the row count. (above pattern contains 5 rows)
row = 5
# start: 1
# stop: row+1 (range never include stop number in result)
# step: 1
# run loop 5 times
for i in range(1, row + 1, 1):
    # Run inner loop i+1 times
    for j in range(1, i + 1):
        print(j, end=' ')
    # empty line after each row
    print("")
Exercise 4: Write a program to print multiplication table of a given number

num = 2

for i in range(1, 11, 1):
    tich = num*i
    print(tich)

Exercise 5: Display numbers from a list using loop

The number must be divisible by five
If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number
If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop

numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

for num in numbers:
    if num > 500:
        break
    elif num % 5 == 0 and num <= 150:
        print(num)

Exercise 6: Count the total number of digits in a number

Write a program to count the total number of digits in a number using a while loop.

n = 879879843579
string_n = str(n)
count_n = 0
i = 1

while i in range(len(string_n)):
    if int(string_n[i]) == True:
